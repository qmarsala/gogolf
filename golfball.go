// todo: eventually we will want to 'shape' the shot

// - I also think it it probably best this func does not actually change the location
// and instead returns a path, so that we can do collision detection on the hole and tall hazards like trees
// the collision detection on the hole is going to be really important.  A simple alternative
// for now, could be to check if it is within a few points of the hole.  Though I think the collision
// will be much better.
